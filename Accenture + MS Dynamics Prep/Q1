My advice to you is look through everything you have learned. 


Make sure you understand there basics such as customization but 
also understand the business side of why dynamics works there way 
it does. What is it for and why does it help? After that, make sire
you understand security and custom scripting. 


Unfortunately I can't
 tell you that anything you have learned about dynamics is not
  important and you will probably be asked a little bit about most, 
  if not all, of the subjects. 
  
  If you get asked a practical question, where they ask how to 
  implement a solution to a given scenario, go through everything 
  relevant starting with customization. 
  
  Explain why they do our don't
   fit there scenario and 
   
   what drawbacks come with that implementation
    ad you determine your solution. 
    
    Let them know why you are choosing
     the solution.
