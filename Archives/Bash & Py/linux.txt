>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
ls - list files and directories. You can highlight common flags like -d, -a, -l, ...
rm - remove files and directories. You should mention -r for recursive removal
rmdir - remove directories but you should mention it's possible to use rm for that
grep - print lines that match patterns. Could be nice to mention -v, -r, -E flags
wc - print newline, word, and byte counts
curl - tranfer a URL or mention common usage like downloading files, API calls, ...
touch - update timestamps but common usage is to create files
man - reference manuals
ns lookup or dig - query nameservers
df - provides info regarding file system disk space usage

    1-grep '[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}' some_file
    2-grep -E "error|failure" some_file
    3-grep '[0-9]$' some_file

1-An IP address
2-The word "error" or "failure"
3-Lines which end with a number

causing erratics behaviours. You would solve this by fixing your $PATH variable:
