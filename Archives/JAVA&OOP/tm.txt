15min Main Question
You have a 25gb file of words on each line, You only have 2gb of Ram to process it, Sort it Alphabetically, how would it be done?  

Quicksort a fragment 1/10 of the file, using an ARRAYLIST to go both directions (linkedlist is unilateral), then use merge sort to combine the 10 files.

Create a system design, that covers everything. You want to fly a plane to los-angeles with a controller to pick up a friend and bring him to home in seatac, you want to do this without leaving your house or going to los angeles. How would you create a system to do this?

Model- It represents the application data domain. In other words applications business logic is contained within the model and is responsible for maintaining data
View- It represents the user interface, with which the end users communicates. In short all the user interface logic is contained within the VIEW
Controller- It is the controller that answers to user actions. Based on the user actions, the respective controller responds within the model and choose a view to render that display the user interface. The user input logic is contained with-in the controller

List out few different return types of a controller action method?

View Result
Javascript Result
Redirect Result
Json Result
Content Result

Advantages 

It represents clear separation between business logic and presentation logic
Each MVC object has different responsibilities
The development progresses in parallel
Easy to manage and maintain
All classes and object are independent of each other

Interview 2 - Javascript + Design Questions

How would you test, what values would you input into perameriers
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
What is javascript and what is it used for?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

What are the downsides of javascript?
Javascript is dynamicly typed, so types needs to implicetly defined
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
How can javascript return objects?
Js objects can be interpred as JSON
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
Can JavaScript Be asynchronous? 

And how - callback functions
Yes, by using asynchronous js, and writing promises and callbacks to functions.
asy

When JavaScript is executed, synchronous code has the potential to block further execution until it has finished what it’s doing. In English, long-running JavaScript functions can make the UI or server unresponsive until the function has returned. Obviously this can result in a terrible user-experience.

For example: if you want to load your latest tweets onto a web page, and you do this synchronously, then a visitor to your site won’t be able to do anything until those tweets are loaded. This could cause a long delay before they even get to see the content of your site! I’ve illustrated the problem below:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
Why do we use try catch? For the users, programmer, and to know where errors happened

Catch errors. try,catch finally

What is the issue with putting many parameters in one function 

The function is doing too much. It should be split into several smaller functions, each which have a smaller parameter set.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Is javascript object oriented? 

JavaScript is heavily object-based. Objects are associative arrays, augmented with prototypes (see below). 
Object property names are 
associative array 
**********
keys: obj.x = 10 and obj["x"] = 10 
**********
are equivalent, the dot notation being merely syntactic sugar. Properties and their values can be added, changed, or deleted at run-time. 
The properties of an object can also be enumerated via a for...in loop.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Javascript is an object oriented programming language, nevertheless in 2015 with ECMA script 6 classes have been
introduced and now is correct to use them like other class based languages like Java. Of course as pointed out
by the user codemagician in his/her comment, there are some deep differences between how classes work in js and 
java or other "class based" programming languages.

Nevertheless now in js programming is possible to use for example code like:

class Animal { 
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }


class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(this.name + ' barks.');
  }
}

What kind of data structures have you used and why did you use them in your projects over each other? Hashmaps pros/cons, linked lists pro/cons, arraylist pro/cons (use array list for quick sort a file A-Z)
