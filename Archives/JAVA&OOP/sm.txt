diff between sql and nosql? Key:

**SQL RDBMS 
NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database.

**SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases 
can be document based, key-value pairs, graph databases.

**SQL databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL databases 
are horizontally scalable. --You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, 
RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL 
databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more
 servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle 
 the large traffic.

**SQL databases have a predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases 
use dynamic schema for unstructured data

For the type of data to be stored: 
SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. 
But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage 
as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to 
JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data 
set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

SQL-
Examples	Oracle, Postgres, and MS-SQL. MySQL

NOSQL-
MongoDB, Redis, , Neo4j, Cassandra, Hbase.

What is Singleton Class in Java ? it's a design pattern. 
Wher you make it so you're only allowed for ONE 
insrtance of the class,

1-you make a new instance in the class as static in the class, 
example,
2-declare a constructor as private. so now you can't call abc() in main
3- create a static, create method that returns a obj instance of abc
4- in main call Abc obj1 = Abc.getinstance;

class abc {
    static Abc obj = new Abc();
    private Abc() {
    }
    public static Abc getinstance() {
        return Abc;
    }

The Four Pillars of Object Oriented Design
Abstraction-Abstraction means that we don’t create one class for Robert’s bank account and separate class for Julia’s bank account. Instead, we will write one BankAccount class.
It might be true that every bank account was opened on a specific
 date but if our application doesn’t care about that piece of 
 information, we don’t need to define that attribute in our class 
 but as we’ll see, it’s abstraction that is the foundation that 
 supports other fundamentals of object orientation such as 
 inheritance and polymorphism.

 Of course Abstraction is interested with Inheritance. But there are some important points.
First of all when you mark a class as abstract you cannot create an instance. This is very important. Abstract classes are used to be inherited only.
EXTEMND
Polymorphism-abstraction is interested with Polymorphism. Abstraction forces us to Polymorphism.

Inheritance-WE CAN create AN INSTANCE AND WE CAN EXTEND

Encapsulation-  information hiding. The principal is that the object should not reveal anything about itself except what is absolute necessary for others parts of application to work.

Asymmetric Encryption (RSA/HTTP handshake) is a form of Encryption where keys come 
in pairs. What one key encrypts, only the other can decrypt. 
Frequently (but not necessarily), the keys are interchangeable, 
in the sense that if key A encrypts a message, 
then B can decrypt it, and if key B encrypts a message,
 then key A can decrypt it.

 Asymmetric Encryption uses two distinct, yet related keys. 
 One key, the Public Key, is used for encryption and the other, 
 the Private Key, is for decryption. As implied in the name, 
 the Private Key is intended to be private so that only the 
 authenticated recipient can decrypt the message.

The sender after encrypting "The Private Key" with the receiver's
public key, the sender will has to encrypt the result with
his/her private key to generate the final message before 
sending. After receiving the message, the receiver will then 
need to first decrypt the message with the sender public key.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
You’re using Asymmetric Encryption without even realizing it
When you visit any HTTPS website/webpage, your browser establishes Asymmetrically 
encrypted connection with that website. Your browser automatically derives the 
public key of the SSL/TLS certificate installed on the website 
(that’s why it’s called ‘Public Key’).

So, this key encrypts any information you send to our website during 
the initial handshake, and our Private Key will decrypt

Symmetric Encryption	
The Two-square cipher, also called double Playfair, is a manual 
symmetric encryption technique.[1] 

Symmetric encryption consists of one of key for encryption and decryption.
