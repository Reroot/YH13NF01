Difference between Multiprocessing and Multithreading:

S.NO	MULTIPROCESSING	MULTITHREADING
1.	In Multiprocessing, CPUs are added for increasing computing power. | While In Multithreading, many threads are created of a single process for increasing computing power.
2.	In Multiprocessing, Many processes are executed simultaneously. | 	While in multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously.
3.	Multiprocessing are classified into Symmetric and Asymmetric. |	While Multithreading is not classified in any categories.
4.	In Multiprocessing, Process creation is a time-consuming process. |	While in Multithreading, process creation is according to eco
